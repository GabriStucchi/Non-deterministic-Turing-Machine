# Non-deterministic Turing Machine

A non-deterministic Turing Machine simulator build in C.

## How to Run
Run the code `turing.c` providing one of the text file in the `input` as input on stdin. The input file contains the initialization of the Turing Machine and the strings to be tested.

The code will output `1` for an accepted string, `0` for a non-accepted string and `U` for undefined (the computation exceed the maximum number of steps provided in the input).

More information about the assignment can be found on `Consegna.pdf`
